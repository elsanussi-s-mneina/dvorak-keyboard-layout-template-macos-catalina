# DVORAK Keyboard Layout Template
# About the No-Caps Branch

This branch does not support caps lock. Pressing caps lock with this version of the keyboard layout does nothing at all. Why? I intend to use sticky keys with shift in order to access the capital letters. I can achieve behaviour similar to caps-lock by pressing shift twice.
